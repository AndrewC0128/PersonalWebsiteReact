I'm a Full Stack Developer at ExxonMobil and graduate of Baylor University. Which is a fancy way of saying: I work with software on the server and client side of applications, and I went to school to learn techniques of how to best develop and implement software.

Iâ€™m passionate about modern technologies, as well as people who use them. Most of my time is spent either researching new technologies, reading self-help books, or lifting.
