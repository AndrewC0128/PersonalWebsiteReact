I'm a Software Developer at Paycom and graduate of Baylor University. Which is a fancy way of saying: I will be creating useful technologies for every part of a company's workforce, and I went to school to learn techniques of how to best develop software.

Iâ€™m passionate about modern technologies, as well as people who use them. Most of my time is spent either researching new technologies, reading self-help books, or lifting weights.
