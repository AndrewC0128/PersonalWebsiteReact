I'm a Software Developer at Paycom and graduate of Baylor University. Which is a fancy way of saying: I create useful software for every part of a company's workforce and I went to school to learn techniques of how to best develop software and its implementation.

Iâ€™m passionate about modern technologies, as well as people who use them. Most of my time is spent either researching new technologies, reading self-help books, or lifting.
