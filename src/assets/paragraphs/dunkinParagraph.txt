At the age of sixteen, I was excited to enter the workforce and get my first real paycheck. Although minimum wage isn’t ideal for most, working for me was an experience to learn, be social, and get paid (decently). I immediately befriended the majority of the staff and owner, realizing my passion for the customer service industry. The staff was smaller at this particular Dunkin Donuts, providing a more family-like environment amongst coworkers and frequent customers.

Within my first few months of employment, my best friend was promoted to General Manager, supplying me with more knowledge pertaining to Dunkin’s general procedures for food safety. These lessons became crucial during truck deliveries and ensuring consistent guest experience at all hours. To prevent possible mistakes, I created a guideline and organizational system for employees to follow. Later that year, I began working for PDQ too, while attending Lone Star College. Although demanding, I refined my time management skills and improved my ability to compartmentalize differing problems. Leaving Dunkin Donuts was tough, but my admiration for people and coffee alike still remains today.
