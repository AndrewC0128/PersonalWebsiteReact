Although I do not live in Houston anymore, I still volunteer whenever possible. As a teenager, I was blessed with the opportunity to partake in various YMCA trips/camps, teaching me necessary skills for life. Now, I believe it is my turn to give back, not only to the organization that provided me with so much but to local communities as well.

The Christian Values Conference is a life-changing summer trip that displays the world in the way that you wouldn’t think is possible. Using the solitude of a mountain, this experience breaks all social norms and allows teens to overcome problematic situations in their lives together. For me, being social was a part of life and was never challenging, public speaking was a different story.

Youth and Government not only improved my public speaking ability but emphasized the importance of speaking with confidence. During my second state competition, we traveled to Texas’ state capital in Austin and presented our proposals in the Senate Chamber.
