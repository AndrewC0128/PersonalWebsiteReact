Growing up in Texas, I had always heard of the great culture that H-E-B provides to its employees, as well as its customers. During the summer of 2019, I had the pleasure of getting to work on the POS Team and work on many different projects with fellow interns, and employees alike. This enabled me to gain firsthand experience with Scrum Meetings and Agile Development. More specifically, I learned Android Development and contributed to an internal application that was set to launch shortly after my internship. Also, I presented a proof of concept project with H-E-B GO with code implementation too.
