Student Government is responsible for representing the Baylor student body on campus. We partner with the Board of Regents, administration, faculty & staff, and alumni to ensure students are included in the decision-making process. We also work with student organizations to provide funding, through the Student Government Allocation Fund (SGAF) for on-campus events.
