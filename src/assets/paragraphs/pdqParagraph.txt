What first peaked my interest about PDQ was their slogan, “People Dedicated to Quality”; within the fast food industry, a “quality person” can be hard to come by, let alone “people.” While the location was being built, I met with the General Manager and Operating Director. As soon as the interview was finished, I realized my deep desire to work with them and learn from them. They enforced important standards of quality, both in customer service and food, while promoting safety and cleanliness (two things that I am very particular about).

Within 3 months, I became a trainer for new hires on general routines and furthered my goal of learning everything within the restaurant. After a year of employment, I was promoted to a Shift Manager, solely responsible for the restaurant during opening/closing hours. During this time, I realized the importance of servant leadership and the power of success through teamwork. Just like any job, complications came and went, but overall I miss PDQ and everyone I met while there.
