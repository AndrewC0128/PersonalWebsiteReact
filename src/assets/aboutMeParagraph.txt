I’m a student at Baylor University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about computers, as well as the people who use them. Most of my time is spent either studying or working out while socializing with others around me.

I have experience in restaurant management, coding languages, and outreach programs. I hope to fulfill my dreams of making an impact larger than just my local community.
